## Retrieval Roulette {#roulette}

[Download Roulette here](https://github.com/MrReedSWCHS/teacher-tools/raw/main/downloads/roulette.xlsx).

The retrieval roulette is a bank of questions and answers from which a random quiz is automatically generated.[^1]

It supports retrieval practice and spaced repetition: questions from previous and current topics are mixed up randomly (at your control).

### Features

![](img/roulette2.png)

* **Questions** sheet holds all the questions and answers (and the topic they fall under).
* **Options** sheet selects which topics to include in the test.
* **1_Q** sheet asks 1 question.
* **5_Q** asks 5 questions. (**5_A** shows answers).
* **10_Q** asks 10 questions. (**10_A** shows answers).
* **Print Q** fills an A4 paper with questions, for homework or test. (**Print A** shows answers)
* **Print KO** randomly hides questions and answers, like a deletion test in a Knowledge Organiser. (**Print A** shows answers)

The MCQ machine generates five multiple-choice questions from a list. You turn individual questions on or off in the **Questions** sheet and Excel will randomly choose five. The order of the responses are also randomised.
